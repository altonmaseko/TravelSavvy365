# TravelSavvy365

**TravelSavvy365** is an application that allows companies to efficiently manage their travel and accommodation arrangements.

## Problem

Companies often struggle to keep track of travel and accommodation requests from multiple employees.  
A designated person must:
- Track each request
- Verify if it’s a valid reason for travel
- Decide on funding
- Organize transport and accommodation

This is typically a **tedious and inefficient process**, especially considering multiple requests from many employees in the company.

## Solution

- Employees can submit travel and optional hotel stay requests.
